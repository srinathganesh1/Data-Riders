Possible Case Studies

- do cluster and discuss....any 4 var...cal must
Q
1. calories, ratings, protein, fat

    - rating -0.6

- if u want to improve rating by X, whats the best way
- if u want to improve rating by p%, whats the best way 
# TODO predict

- which companies produce Product with high VAR-X
- which companies produce Product with low VAR-Y
Top 3
- Company wise rating

- cereal wise rating
- new variable : high cal,  low cal and make a Freq chart ---- data manup
PENDING

- does shelf have any influence in the rating



Company wise variety...how many options do they give

find skew in each variable
 
Company c1 - prod p1 VS c2 p2 

problems w.r.t dev:
- what sense does outliers make

IF YOU GIVE US THESE DATA, WE COULD MAKE MORE ACCURATE RESEARCH
- What is the selling price
- How much $ Sales
- How many units sold

Did analysis on finding on the following
- Cluster
- Company based profiling
- Identifying trends with visualization 
- Planned the contents for the presentation




PPT Slides
1. What is missing in the data / What more parameters will improve the study (Client does not always knows what is required to get the job done, we have to identify gaps and through a iterative process reduce the gaps in the data)
- What is the selling price (does branding give fake goodness tag)
- How much $ Sales / Units Sold (Market Share of Products/Companies)

- Fixing Missing Value
3. Cluster Analysis
4. Word Cloud

6. Correlation Charts. self-life and rating
7. 
8.
